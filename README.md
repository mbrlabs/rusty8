# rusty8

rusty8 is a chip-8 emulator written in Rust.  

## About
This project is mainly about learning how to program in Rust and to refresh my rusty knowledge of low level
programming skills. 
The emulator is fully functional, although some things could certainly be improved.
I used the Piston game engine for rendering, input & sound.

In order to run this, you have to insall Rust and the package manager cargo.
For building type `cargo build --release`. You sould find the compiled program in the targets folder.

Usage: `rusty8 PATH_TO_ROM_GOES_HERE`
